# SHIDE
This repository provides the official R implementation of SHIDE (Simulation and Histogram Interpolation for Density Estimation), a simulation-based density estimator that generates pseudo-data through convolution with bounded noise kernels and applies spline interpolation to the resulting histogram. Compared to classical kernel density estimation (KDE), SHIDE offers superior boundary bias handling, improved computational efficiency, and native support for constrained random variables including positive/negative-valued and bounded distributions.
